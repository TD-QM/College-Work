A TCP Client-Server game called the Game of Mao.

I am allowed to share with you a few of rules regarding the game. 
1. There is no speaking during the Game of Mao, unless otherwise specified by a rule.
1. If you recieve a penalty while at 10 cards or higher, you automatically lose.
1.  The game begins with the first person playing, then the second, and so on. 
    - The word "allusers" may be typed into the chat freely. This pulls up the list of players in the game.
I will not divulge the rest the rules of the Game of Mao, that is up to you to figure out.
I encourage you to not look up the rules of the game, as that ruins the sanctity of the game.
Are you willing to play?
